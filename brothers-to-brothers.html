<h1>Brothers to Brothers (Male Initiative)</h1>
<p>Nationally, male students tend to be the most difficult to engage on campus and tend to perform the least well.  At Norfolk State University, this concept adversely affects the ability of academic affairs to increase undergraduate retention and graduation rates of that specific student population.  The Brothers 2 Brothers Initiative will serve as an opportunity to retain male students at NSU more effectively through social involvement, building camaraderie, and making strong connections with peers and professionals alike.</p>


<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The mission of the Brothers 2 Brothers Initiative is to provide an avenue for male students at Norfolk State University to create a community of learning and growth academically, personally, socially and professionally.  These students will be able to help facilitate their own success by developing a network of peers, faculty, and staff while using other campus resources to increase their ability to navigate through college.  Through this initiative, males will become more self-aware and better suited to understand themselves, the struggle of minority male students in college, and the importance of not only attending but graduating from college.</p>

<h2>Goals and Possible Outcomes </h2>
<ul>
	<li>Personal and professional development opportunities for students such as resume workshops, book reviews, leadership conferences etc.</li>

	<li>Connection with or network of other male students, faculty, and staff on campus</li>

	<li>Platform for open and honest dialogue amongst peers</li>

	<li>Development of a social support system or “brotherhood”</li>

	<li>Possibility of Brothers 2 Brothers Initiative putting on a conference, holding a retreat, or turning into a student organization </li>
</ul>

<h2>Initiative Specifics </h2>
<p>The program will consist of bi-weekly structured meetings where constituents will come and discuss agreed upon topics with peers, faculty members, and other university staff.  Once a month, the program will also provide separate social and developmental opportunities such as resume workshops, guest speakers, and social events.  The meetings will be conducted by one or more facilitators.  The Spartan Success Center will serve as the overseeing department and provide financial support when needed.  </p>

<h2>Program Synapsis</h2>
<p>The Brothers 2 Brothers Initiative will give male students of color the opportunity to create a sense of connectedness and belonging at Norfolk State University.  The creation of this link has the ability to enhance undergraduate retention amongst this student population and empower these students with the confidence to exceed expectations.  Minority male students more connected to the campus will not only be inspired to succeed in their own lives but inspired to also aid in the personal, professional, and academic achievements of their peers.  This community of growth and development will be able to flourish and thrive at this increasingly accomplished university.  </p>
